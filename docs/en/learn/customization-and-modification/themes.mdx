# Themes

The calendar supports dark and light themes, one of the themes is applied by default depending on the user's settings.

If your site only supports one theme, or if you want your calendar to look different, you can force any of the themes.

By the way, since we're forcing one theme on, we don't need to load an extra css file.

Remove extra css import and activate dark theme.

<Sandbox example="customization-and-modification-themes-dark" themeDetection={false} />

And now the same thing, only with the `'light'` theme.

<Sandbox example="customization-and-modification-themes-light" themeDetection={false} />
